# Airline-Flight-Delays

## About the Project

Records for 5,000,000+ commercial airline flights in 2015, compiled for the U.S. DOT Air Travel Consumer Report. Each record represents a single flight, including the airline name, flight number, the origin/destination airport, and flight distance, as well as scheduled/actual departure and arrival times.

### Description of the datasets

There were four (4) Tables which includes:

- Flights

- Airlines

- Cancellation codes

- Airports.

The datasets are in CSV format hence importing the datasets through csv source on PowerBi, After transforming the datasets into power query there was a need for cleaning and merging of tables as I have 4 tables to extract information from to gain meaningful insights as required.
